## SHOCKING REVERSAL!

With consistent 1-year periods, **2022 was the BEST period** for static strategies!

### Summary Across All Periods

| Period | Static Avg | Kalman Avg | Winner | Spread |
|--------|------------|------------|--------|--------|
| 2017 Bull | -7.18% | +5.52% | Kalman | +12.7% |
| 2019 Pre-COVID | -10.06% | +11.62% | Kalman | +21.7% |
| 2020 COVID | -4.49% | -0.52% | Kalman | +4.0% |
| 2021 Recovery | +4.03% | +5.51% | Kalman | +1.5% |
| **2022 Fed Hikes** | **+37.97%** | **-9.76%** | **Static** | **+47.7%** |

## Key Findings (REVISED)

1. **2022 was EXCEPTIONAL for static strategies** (+37.97% avg!)
   - Best period across all 5 years tested
   - Static beat Kalman by a massive 47.7%
   - NKE/TMO: +54.74% (best single result)

2. **Kalman dominated 2017-2021** (4 out of 5 periods)
   - Average advantage: +10% across those 4 periods
   - Best in 2019: +21.7% advantage

3. **The 2022 anomaly**
   - Only period where static dramatically outperformed
   - Suggests relationships were MORE stable in 2022 than previous years
   - Fed hikes created predictable, persistent trends

4. **Overall Performance**
   - **Kalman**: 4 wins, average across all periods: +2.67%
   - **Static**: 1 win (but massive), average across all periods: +4.95%
   - Static's one big win (+37.97%) pulled up its overall average

## Conclusion

**Original hypothesis was BACKWARDS!**

2022-2023 wasn't bad for pairs trading - it was the **BEST period** for static strategies (+37.97%). The Fed hikes created stable, predictable relationships that static hedge ratios could exploit.

Kalman Filter works better in MOST market conditions (2017-2021) but FAILED in 2022 when relationships became more stable and trending.

**Practical Insight**: Use Kalman in normal volatile markets, but switch to static when you see strong, persistent trends (like Fed hiking cycles).
